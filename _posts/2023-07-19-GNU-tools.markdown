## Background

During my internship at qualcomm I had to debug a ton of C++ code. A fortunate or unfortunate fact of this entailed looking at binaries and how they get compiled. This lead me down some interesting rabit holes on the C++ language, Bugs in the GCC compiler and how some tools in the GNU exist that help, no fancy IDEs.
